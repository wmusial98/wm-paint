# wm-paint
Paint tool developed in javascript alongside the Odin Project

## Basic Functionality
I added basic functionality as described in the Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch page, found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch
Additionally, I added a slider at the top that determined the number of pixels in the canvas, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 100.
#### Future Changes to Implement
Add more pen colors
Add eraser function
Add pixel borders without interfering with canvas. Right now, adding a border adds to the div container, pushing the last few divs in a row to the next row.
Add reset button
