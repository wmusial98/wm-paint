# wm-paint
Paint tool developed in javascript alongside the Odin Project

## Basic Functionality
I added basic functionality as described in the Odin Project Etch-a-Sketch page, found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch
Additionally, I added a slider at the top that determined the number of pixels in the canvas, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 100.
#### Future Changes to Implement
<ul>
<li>Add more pen colors</li>
<li>Add eraser function</li>
<li>Add pixel borders without interfering with canvas. Right now, adding a border adds to the div container, pushing the last few divs in a row to the next row.</li>
<li>Add reset button</li>
</ul>


## Basic UI Update
I added more functionality and a basic user interface - the program is now centered and has a working menu bar. The menu bar has pen colors to choose from, a slider for scaling the size of each pixel on the canvas, and a reset button so that users can add more than one color to the canvas at a time. 
#### Future Changes to Implement
<ul>
<li>Add a full color wheel for picking colors.</li>
<li>Add eraser functionality (is currently the color "white").</li>
<li>Add a pixel border toggle button</li>
<li>Add background and more aesthetically pleasing UI</li>
</ul>
